# TreeAR Assets

Created Feb 21, 2026.

Copy these assets from your Swift Playground into this folder to enable the full AR experience:

## SceneKit (.scn) files
- `hole1.scn`, `hole2.scn`, `hole3.scn` – hole digging animation
- `flatHole.scn` – flat hole variant
- `seed.scn` – seed model
- `holeAndLeaf1.scn`, `holeAndLeaf2.scn`, `holeAndLeaf3.scn` – sprout stages
- `cloud.scn` – rain cloud
- `simpleTree.scn` – grown tree
- `applesSizeVariation.scn` – apples on tree (or `apples.scn`)

## Particle system
- `rainParticleSystem.scnp` – rain effect (in same directory as .scn files)

## Audio (.mp3) files
- `introduction.mp3` – intro screen
- `name.mp3`, `oxygen.mp3`, `thanks.mp3` – narration
- `SunnyWeather.mp3`, `RainyWeather.mp3`, `Rain.mp3` – ambient sounds

The app will run with placeholder geometry if these files are missing, but the full experience requires all assets.
